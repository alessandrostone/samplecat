todo:
 v0.3.X:
  -file-manager: rmdir/mkdir, unlink+confirm
  -interactive import - similar, duplicate files.
  -re-connect files when moved external to samplecat
   * search new file 
   * mass-updates
   * compare md5sum ? or compare already known audio-properties (frames, peaklevel)
  -fix dnotify/inotify code - it does not seem to do anything.
  -select, expand and scroll to prev. folder in dir-tree-view (bottom-left) on startup.
 v0.4.X:
  -allow to modify/add/delete preset-categories/tags and remember changes.

sometime:
  -minor GUI redesign:
   * make "play" move obvious: tooltip on waveform, play-icon overlay?
   * move "loop" from menu->pref to player_control.
   * make use of the two status-bars.
  -major GUI redesign.
   * preferences and about windows
   * fix focus-save behaviour of notes and tag-edit in inspector.
   * add button and/or shortcut to reset colours of played files.
  -fix compiler warnings in file manager code. remove cruft.
  -look at spek (vala spectrogram) -- but why? sndfile's spectrogram is great :)
  -GtkInfBar added in gtk 2.18 - we should probably use it instead of the message_panel__ functions in window.c 
  -show warning icon in statusbar - eggtrayicon.c ?
  -check out libsexy SexyUrlLabel (for tags) 
  -check out chickensys samplemanage.
  -check with valgrind. -- needs suppression file for gtk libs
  -how to programmatically enter treeview cell edit mode? (see code)
  -add date to database so we can sort by date and show f-spot style bar chart for years. -- mtime already present in model
  -DnD out of samplecat on OSX to non GTK apps (it works with ardour, but not with OSX-Finder)
  -better meta_data handling and meta-data edit.
  -add support for sample-libs (sf2, etc).
  -ffmpge decoder: parse and set bit_depth.
  -move player-code into sub-directory src/audio_players/ ?
  -save EBU loudness information in searchable format. - serialize struct
  -allow to search/filter on sample-traits: duration, max/min loudness, sample-rate
  -allow to configure a custom command to audition audio-files.
  -built in JACK player: compensate for latency/delay between libsamplerate and rubberband when updating parameters in real-time.
  -bug or feature? newly imported files are added to the view - regardless of the search query filter.
  -import/update files/dir -> queue, background processing.
  -non-interactive import: List of postponed import tasks. /icon in taskbar -> popup conflict-resolver UI/.

removable media:
  -currently we (probably?) dont store the volume name.
  -you can get a (UUID) volume name using libudev.

file system trees:
  -the first implementation was based on devhelp and worked ok, but didnt do too much.
  -second implementation used gqview's gtkclist implemtation - aborted due to implementation of gtktreeview theming into gtk2.10.
  -3rd implementation uses gqviews gtktreeview imlementation - not yet finished.

-databases:
  -mysql has an 'embedded' mode, ie it can be used without a daemon. Ideally it would be nice to support this. Used by Amarok for example.
